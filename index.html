            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">LGBTQ rights have witnessed unprecedented legal and political successes in a relatively short period of time across much of the world. Protective legislation and equal rights have saturated in much of the developed world while breakthroughs have been increasingly recorded throughout several key countries within the global South. However, much of this progress is now under considerable stress, as both domestic and international equality efforts face an uncertain future. Democratic elections in Europe and the U.S.A have resulted in a radical and rapid shift in leadership towards conservative values and right wing politics, accompanied by increased vitriol against gender, racial, sexual, religious and other minorities.</h3>
            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">The effects of this change will have significant impact on our lives and communities, as we have lost crucial allies in senior government positions and potentially face the suspension or reversal of decades of progress.  Increasing numbers of homophobic and transphobic attacks are being reported, targeting specifically queer immigrants and queer people of color. In addition, LGBT activists abroad also face the potential diminishment of political and financial support for their projects and organizations, made all that more severe with the increase in conflict and state repression as well as the impact of mass migrations. There is great uncertainty regarding the policies and politics of the next few years, especially how they will translate on the ground and to the extent our communities will be targeted.</h3>
            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">This conference comes at a crucial juncture in which LGBTQ activists are compelled to mobilize once more to act and insure that their lives, livelihoods, families, and communities are safeguarded and protected. It builds on the explorations of intersectionality made in the previous conference but concentrates on how this should and is being reflected on the ground. It heralds a return to grassroots advocacy and community mobilization and engagement en masse to analyze, anticipate, and act for ensuring the progress we have made with regards to equality, dignity, and justice is protected and unabated. The coming period also offers unprecedented opportunity to build alliances of resistance with other communities facing similar challenges in our collective fight for civil rights.</h3>

              <h3>Ruth Marimo</h3>
              <h2>Author/ Entrepreneur, New Leaders Council Omaha </h2>
              <p>Ruth Marimo is a 35 year old single mother of two who lives in Papillion, Nebraska. She has authored two books, a memoir titled Outsider: Crossing Borders, Breaking Rules, Gaining Pride, which chronicles her immigration journey from her country of origin, Zimbabwe, as well as the complexities of being a multiple minority; and a work of fiction titled Indelicate Things. Marimo was a TEDX Omaha speaker for 2015 and owns a residential and commercial cleaning business. Being a voice for the marginalized is something Marimo is deeply passionate about, and she speaks and fights for many causes including racial equality, immigration reform and LGBTQ equality. She is especially interested in working to change the mindsets of vulnerable populations through education on issues such as: the disproportionate impact of the HIV epidemic on African Americans, the importance of comprehensive sex education in schools, and the importance of early reading among children of minorities and immigrants. Through her worldly experiences, Marimo seeks to impart some of the knowledge she has gained with her peers in Africa, using the values she learned there to give people in the United States a different perspective. Ruth also enjoys the challenges that come with being a small business owner and being able to give other people an income while providing an essential service. Her number one job is raising her two children, age 10 and 12, who excel in both sports and academics.</p>

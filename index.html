            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">LGBTQ rights have witnessed unprecedented legal and political successes in a relatively short period of time across much of the world. Protective legislation and equal rights have saturated in much of the developed world while breakthroughs have been increasingly recorded throughout several key countries within the global South. However, much of this progress is now under considerable stress, as both domestic and international equality efforts face an uncertain future. Democratic elections in Europe and the U.S.A have resulted in a radical and rapid shift in leadership towards conservative values and right wing politics, accompanied by increased vitriol against gender, racial, sexual, religious and other minorities.</h3>
            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">The effects of this change will have significant impact on our lives and communities, as we have lost crucial allies in senior government positions and potentially face the suspension or reversal of decades of progress.  Increasing numbers of homophobic and transphobic attacks are being reported, targeting specifically queer immigrants and queer people of color. In addition, LGBT activists abroad also face the potential diminishment of political and financial support for their projects and organizations, made all that more severe with the increase in conflict and state repression as well as the impact of mass migrations. There is great uncertainty regarding the policies and politics of the next few years, especially how they will translate on the ground and to the extent our communities will be targeted.</h3>
            <h3 class="section-subcontent wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">This conference comes at a crucial juncture in which LGBTQ activists are compelled to mobilize once more to act and insure that their lives, livelihoods, families, and communities are safeguarded and protected. It builds on the explorations of intersectionality made in the previous conference but concentrates on how this should and is being reflected on the ground. It heralds a return to grassroots advocacy and community mobilization and engagement en masse to analyze, anticipate, and act for ensuring the progress we have made with regards to equality, dignity, and justice is protected and unabated. The coming period also offers unprecedented opportunity to build alliances of resistance with other communities facing similar challenges in our collective fight for civil rights.</h3>

              <h3>Ruth Marimo</h3>
              <h2>Author/ Entrepreneur, New Leaders Council Omaha </h2>
              <p>Ruth Marimo is a 35 year old single mother of two who lives in Papillion, Nebraska. She has authored two books, a memoir titled Outsider: Crossing Borders, Breaking Rules, Gaining Pride, which chronicles her immigration journey from her country of origin, Zimbabwe, as well as the complexities of being a multiple minority; and a work of fiction titled Indelicate Things. Marimo was a TEDX Omaha speaker for 2015 and owns a residential and commercial cleaning business. Being a voice for the marginalized is something Marimo is deeply passionate about, and she speaks and fights for many causes including racial equality, immigration reform and LGBTQ equality. She is especially interested in working to change the mindsets of vulnerable populations through education on issues such as: the disproportionate impact of the HIV epidemic on African Americans, the importance of comprehensive sex education in schools, and the importance of early reading among children of minorities and immigrants. Through her worldly experiences, Marimo seeks to impart some of the knowledge she has gained with her peers in Africa, using the values she learned there to give people in the United States a different perspective. Ruth also enjoys the challenges that come with being a small business owner and being able to give other people an income while providing an essential service. Her number one job is raising her two children, age 10 and 12, who excel in both sports and academics.</p>

              <p>Originally trained as an economist and holding an MSc in Development Management, he reached high management levels in public service since very early in his career. In 2006 political events led him to change my career path towards an electoral project. He was one of the founders of the Social Democrat Party (PSD) and got elected as one of the Mexico City’s Legislative Assembly Representatives for the 2009–2012 where his major commitment was the Human Rights agenda to which he devoted most of his legislative work. Amongst others, he introduced, pushed and sponsored the Marriage Equality amendment that made Mexico City the first Latin–American jurisdiction in approving such a reform; the Anti–Discrimination Bill that today is an enforced Law in Mexico City, the Bill for the Human Rights Program, also currently enforced. He is currently a Ford Foundation Mason Fellow of the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.</p>

              <h3>Todd Richardson</h3>
              <h2>Board Member, Affirmation Board of Directors</h2>
              <p>Todd Richardson was raised in a traditional Mormon home. Growing up, Todd realized he was attracted to men but was convinced that when he found “the right girl,” the “problem” would go away.</p>
              <p>After serving a Mormon mission and graduating from Brigham Young University, Todd moved to New York City for a career in education. He busied himself with as much church service and work as possible, so as not to have to worry about his sexuality. However, randomly hearing the story of a gay Mormon touched him deeply. It prompted him, for the first time in his life, to seek divine guidance with an open heart and mind. Self-acceptance came as he felt the undeniable peace of God’s acceptance.</p>
              <p>From that peace came the desire to help LGBTQ Mormons.  In 2011 he joined Affirmation: LGBT Mormons, Families &amp; Friends.  The organization seeks to provide resources and fellowship to LGBTQ Mormons and loved ones, while promoting spirituality and seeking dialogue with the Mormon Church.  The organization has experienced exponential growth in the past 5 years, despite the Church's stance on homosexuality.  Todd has volunteered on Affirmation's leadership team in various capacities including outreach director, senior vice president, and is now a member of Affirmation's board of directors.</p>
              <p>Todd currently lives in Harlem were he is the principal of a middle school.</p>

              <h3>Imam Daayiee Abdullah<br></h3>
              <h2>Executive Director, MECCA Institute</h2>
              <p>Imam Daayiee Abdullah is a prominent human and sexuality rights activist within Muslim and interfaith contexts, and is the only openly gay Imam in the United States of America. He was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan in an educated community with parents that were community activists. Daayiee began his own activism within the gay community while he was living in San Francisco, and continued throughout his time in Washington and past his graduation form Georgetown University, in 1997, he traveled to Saudi Arabia to teach for the Royal Saudi Airforce. While there, he researched a homosexual positive interpretation of the Quran. In that work he argues that homosexuality is not an issue in Islam because his comparison of various interpretations of the Quran reveals that interpreters made generalizations and misrepresentations of the original Arabic. Daayiee became an authority on homosexuality and Islam and traveled widely lecturing that the Quran does not speak against homosexuality. He frequently lectures internationally on progressive Muslim concepts, interfaith networking and the development of inclusive revisions of Islamic theological thought and interpretations of the shari’ah and fiqh. In addition to this work, he has served as moderator for the Muslim Gay Men Discussion group for over 10 years. Currently, he is active with the Muslims for Progressive Values organization as an advisory board member and D.C. co-chapter leader. He is the Imam and Educational Director of Masjid el-Tawhid An-Nur Al-Isslaah (Mosque for Enlightenment and Reformation) that is affiliated with the el-Tawhid Prayer Circle of Toronto, Ontario in Canada, and the California based organization Muslims for Progressive Values</p>
